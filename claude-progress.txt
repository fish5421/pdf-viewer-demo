# Claude Progress Log
# PDF Viewer Demo with Annotations

This file tracks progress across agent sessions. Each session should read this
file at startup and update it before ending.

================================================================================
## Session 1 - 2025-12-06 23:33 EST - Initialization (Initializer Agent)
================================================================================

### What Was Done
- Created long-running agent harness based on Anthropic's article
  "Effective harnesses for long-running agents"
- Set up CLAUDE.md with two-mode protocol (Initializer vs Coding Agent)
- Created init.sh script for development environment setup
- Created this progress file (claude-progress.txt)
- Created comprehensive feature_list.json with 30 testable features
- Initialized git repository

### Architecture Decisions
- Using JSON for feature list (not Markdown) per article recommendation
  - Less prone to accidental LLM edits
  - Structured format enforces schema
- Feature categories: core, annotation, ui, integration
- Features ordered by priority (core features first)

### Current State
- App runs: YES (verified - HTTP 200 from localhost:5173)
- Features total: 30
- Features passing: 0
- Last tested: 2025-12-06 23:35 EST

### Next Session Should
1. Run ./init.sh to start dev server
2. Verify app loads correctly at http://localhost:5173
3. Pick first failing feature from feature_list.json (ID: 1 - PDF loads from URL)
4. Test and mark as passing if it works
5. Continue with next feature

### Blockers
- None

### Notes
- The app was created by "Manus AI" as a demo project
- Uses EmbedPDF library with PDFium engine
- React 19 + Vite 7 + TypeScript
- Currently implements 5 annotation tools in toolbar (highlight, pen, square,
  circle, freeText) but the EmbedPDF library supports many more

================================================================================
## Session 2 - 2025-12-08 12:00 PST - Coding Agent (infra.core.hybrid-loader)
================================================================================

### What Was Done
- Implemented `infra.core.hybrid-loader` feature - Dual-state PDF loading
- Created `src/services/HybridLoader.ts` - Core service for hybrid loading
- Created `src/hooks/useHybridLoader.ts` - React hook for the service
- Integrated HybridLoader into PDFViewer component
- Added visual status indicator showing "Context Ready (X pages)"
- Exposed `window.Engram.documentContext` API for debugging and LLM integration

### Technical Implementation
- **Visual Layer**: EmbedPDF with PDFium engine (unchanged, renders PDF)
- **Context Layer**: PDF.js for text extraction + Base64 conversion
- **Text Map**: Extracted text items with X/Y coordinates per page
- **Base64**: Full PDF converted to Base64 string (~245KB for 4-page test PDF)
- **API Surface**: `window.Engram.documentContext` with:
  - `base64`: String for LLM API calls
  - `pageCount`: Total pages
  - `textMap`: Array of {pageNumber, textItems, fullText}
  - `metadata`: {title, author, subject}
  - `isReady`: Boolean for readiness check

### Files Created/Modified
- NEW: `src/services/HybridLoader.ts` (HybridLoader service)
- NEW: `src/hooks/useHybridLoader.ts` (React hook)
- MOD: `src/components/PDFViewer.tsx` (integrated HybridLoader)
- MOD: `package.json` (added pdfjs-dist dependency)
- MOD: `feature_list.json` (marked feature as passing)

### Verified
- PDF renders on screen (Visual Layer via EmbedPDF) ✅
- Text items extracted with X/Y coordinates ✅
- Base64 string ready for LLM API calls ✅
- Status indicator shows "Context Ready (4 pages)" ✅

### Current State
- App runs: YES
- Features total: 15
- Features passing: 1 (infra.core.hybrid-loader)
- Last tested: 2025-12-08 12:15 PST

### Next Session Should
1. Run ./init.sh to start dev server
2. Pick next failing feature (suggest: `infra.storage.persistence` or `infra.llm.client`)
3. Test and implement as needed
4. The hybrid-loader is now ready for features that depend on it

### Blockers
- None

### Notes
- PDF.js worker loaded from unpkg CDN (cdnjs had issues)
- HybridLoader is a singleton accessible via `window.Engram.hybridLoader`
- The Base64 output is suitable for Claude/Gemini multimodal API calls
