# Claude Progress Log
# PDF Viewer Demo with Annotations

This file tracks progress across agent sessions. Each session should read this
file at startup and update it before ending.

================================================================================
## Session 1 - 2025-12-06 23:33 EST - Initialization (Initializer Agent)
================================================================================

### What Was Done
- Created long-running agent harness based on Anthropic's article
  "Effective harnesses for long-running agents"
- Set up CLAUDE.md with two-mode protocol (Initializer vs Coding Agent)
- Created init.sh script for development environment setup
- Created this progress file (claude-progress.txt)
- Created comprehensive feature_list.json with 30 testable features
- Initialized git repository

### Architecture Decisions
- Using JSON for feature list (not Markdown) per article recommendation
  - Less prone to accidental LLM edits
  - Structured format enforces schema
- Feature categories: core, annotation, ui, integration
- Features ordered by priority (core features first)

### Current State
- App runs: YES (verified - HTTP 200 from localhost:5173)
- Features total: 30
- Features passing: 0
- Last tested: 2025-12-06 23:35 EST

### Next Session Should
1. Run ./init.sh to start dev server
2. Verify app loads correctly at http://localhost:5173
3. Pick first failing feature from feature_list.json (ID: 1 - PDF loads from URL)
4. Test and mark as passing if it works
5. Continue with next feature

### Blockers
- None

### Notes
- The app was created by "Manus AI" as a demo project
- Uses EmbedPDF library with PDFium engine
- React 19 + Vite 7 + TypeScript
- Currently implements 5 annotation tools in toolbar (highlight, pen, square,
  circle, freeText) but the EmbedPDF library supports many more
